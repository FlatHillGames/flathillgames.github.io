Drag and drop from left side to the empty space on the right side a yellow block that is called "On start", next place block called "wait 1 second" under it and lastly, put block called "Destroy" under "last 1 second" block at the bottom.
You can do this, by attaching one block to the other, like a puzzle.

Save scene by clicking Y button and clicking on the option on the left side of the menu and click save as and confirm. 

Now lets go back to menu and play our experience.
Go back to the option menu and click on the back to menu tab.
